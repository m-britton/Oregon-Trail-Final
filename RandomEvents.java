 * Author: McKinley Britton
 * Description: The RandomEvents class determines whether something random will happen to a group
 *              traveling along the Oregon Trail. These events can be good or bad, and can effect a
 *              range of things from health, weather, food, clothing, and more. Each event has it's
 *              own likelihood, and it is the same for each day traveling along the trail.
