 * Name: Health
 * Date:/ 4/1/23
 * Author: McKinley Britton
 * Description: The Health class takes care of the overall health of a group traveling along the
 *              Oregon Trail. The health is determined by many factors: food, pace, weather, random
 *              events. Health is tracked as a double variable because health is based on a number,
 *              and maxes out at 140. If the group reaches a health of 140, they are days from death.
 *              Thus, the healthier the group is the lower the value of the health variable.
